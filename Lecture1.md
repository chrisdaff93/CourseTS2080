## What is object oriented programming?

- A concept in which you program.
- A way to organize your code.
- Data and objects.
    - How to manipulate data within an object which is an object to a class.
    
- Different than procedure-oriented programming by actually make a system so than the same steps does not need to be repeated.


### ADVANTAGES
- Code reusability.
- Reduses the complexity
- Scalability

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

- Tighly grouped functionality. Within the type that it operates on.
- Code re-use.
    * Pre-defining different structures of code so that several programs and users can access it.
    * Good modularity
- Class-system
    * Class = storage + behavior
- Object
    * Holds/stores data.

- Messages
    * Instead of functions we send a message to an object so the object performs an operation on itself.

## What are the main principles of OOP?

- Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is...

- Bundling: Take several things with similar attributes and "box" them together.
    - Variables
- Data hiding.
    
Types of encapsulation:
- Public: Variables and functions that can be inherited.
- Private: Variables and functions that can not be inheritated.
- Protected: Subclass can inherit.

class Employee:
    def _init_(self, name, project):
        self.name = name
        self.project = project
        
Why use encapsulation?
- Safety/Security
- Accesibility
- Simplicity
- Aesthetics
