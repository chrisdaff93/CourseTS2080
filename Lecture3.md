# UML

### Facts
- General-purpose visual modeling language
- Specify, visualize, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system
- It can show the decisions taken in a software system
- Understand, design, browse, configure, maintain, and control information about such systems
- Tool to communicate between different languages

### Is it a standard?
- No!
	- Extremely time-consuming
	- Very open to interpretation and misunderstanding
- The UML specification does not define a standard process but is intended to be useful with an iterative development process
- UML is not a programming language but can be used to write programs
- Intended to be a universal general-purpose modelling language for GUI
- Simplify and consolidate the large number of object-oriented development methods that had emerged.
- What is a standard?
	- Risk is a key-word in defined what is standards
	- If the result of a software is high risk: Often there is a standard


### Is it Enforced?
- UML was developed in an effort to simplify and consolidate the large number of OO development methods that had emerged
- An effort to unify concepts among methods for books on OO-methodology appeared
- It was imtented to supersede the models of OMT, Booch and Objectory


### Lets travel through time!
- 1996: Object Management Group (OMG) issued a request for proposals for a standard approach to object-oriented modeling which was standardized in November 1997
- 2005: UML 2.0 was introduced
- UML1 should have little trouble using UML2.
- The UML combines the commonly accepted concepts from many object-oriented methods.
- The UML is intended to model most application domains


## BENEFITS OF UML
1. Simplifying - Quick understanding
2. Tool for communication to non-engineers
3. Unites programming languages
4. Future maintanance!
5. Communicate design decisions
6. Independent of technology used

## Types of UML Diagrams
- Generally 14 types of UML-diagrams
- Structural and behavioral diagram
	- Structural: What is looks like
	- Behavioural: What it does / how it developes
- The different diagrams allow for modeling a system from several separate, but related viewpoints permit it to be understood for different purposes



#### Structural
- <b>Class diagram</b>
- Object diagram
- Package diagram
- Component diagram
- Composite structure diagram
- Deployment diagram
- Profile diagram

#### Behavioural
- Use diagram
- Activity diagram
- Sequence diagram
- State diagram
- Communication diagram
- Interaction overview diagram
- Timing diagram


### FACT
- The UML is a modeling language, not a description of a detailed development process

## UML objectives
- Not a complete development method. It does not include a step-by-step development process
- Modern languages and modern operating systems are more complicated than those of 50 years ago because we expect much more of them
- UML has several kinds of models; it is not something you can master in a semester


# COMPLEXITY OF UML #1
- UML is a product of consensus of persons with varied goals and interests.
- It shares the qualities of the product of a democratic process.
- It is not as cean or coherent as the product of a single will.
- It contains superfluous features (but different persons might disagree about precisely what is superfluous)
- It contains overlapping features that are not always well integrated. Most of all, it lacks a consistent viewpoint.
- Intended for all kinds of things, from business modeling to graphic programming.

# COMPLEXITY OF UML #2
- There is a tension between concepts for conceptual modeling and programming language representation, with no consistent guidelines
- You dont have to know or use every feature of UML any more than you need to know or use every feature of a large software application or programming language
- It is unnecessary to listen too much UML language lawyers. There is no single right way to use it

## Contradictions everywhere!
- UML is more than a visual notation. UML models can be used to generate code and test cases.


## Lecture focus
- Use case diagram
- Class diagram
- Activity diagram
- Sequence diagram

# OO Analysis and Design
- Identify objects
	- Waterfall-method: Does a lot of assumptions
- Define relationships
- Establish interface
- Making design executable
